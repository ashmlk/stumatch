                                People will join our forum if they feel safe. We take harm, bullying, and sharing inappropriate content very seriously, and if we learn content and conduct like this, we will take action. 
                                For instance, we may remove the content, restrict access, and in extreme cases, we will remove a user from our platform. 
                                We take this very seriously and try our best to provide a safe community for our users.
